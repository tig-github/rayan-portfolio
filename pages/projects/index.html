      <h2>Women's Safety Website</h2>
      <p class="topper"><a href="https://github.com/ctc-uci/bp-women-safety"> Github </a></p>
      <p>
        The Women's Safety Website is a CTC Blueprint project to be developed over 2 quarters by a team of five. The purpose 
        of the website is to provide resources relating to free menstruel products, abuse assistance, and safety escorts/emergency flagpoles.
        The project is currently in planning stages. Currently developing React-based frontend and planning implementation of dynamic map, with
        a team consisting of four developers and one designer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the website is to provide a centralized and easy to use location for the various services women are able to use on
        campus, such as emergency blue light poles or menstrual products. With time warranting a dynamic map will be developed providing the location
        of menstrual products on campus, otherwise linking currently existing map implementations for emergency resources.

      <h2>GreedyAnts Hackathon Project</h2>
      <p class="topper"><a href="https://github.com/tig-github/GreedyAnts"> Github </a></p>
      <p>
        Hackathon project developed by a team of 5. Allows user to input list of ingredients and recieve ingredient-efficient and cost effective recipe.
        Developed React-based frontend and helped with CSS (vanilla) styling. Backend was built using Python Flask framework, retrieving data with webscraping.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was a lot of fun to build and a great way to get experience. Going into the hackathon, most of us had relatively minimal experience
        in web development. I had developed the portfolio at this point and touched React a little, but mostly went in to learn, while much of the others had 
        minimal webdev experience at all. Over the course of the project we all were able to learn and build a functioning website by the end of the hackathon,
        and I learned a ton of React considering the timespan. Routing the frontend and backend was difficult because of this, but ultimately was 
        able to function with help from some hackathon mentors. It was a great experience and made me gain an appreciation for hackathons.

      <h2>Project Website</h2>
      <p class="topper"><a href="https://github.com/tig-github/rayan-portfolio"> Github </a></p>
      <p>
        This website is the first nontrivial (at the time lol) project developed by me. Development occured during Fall Quarter 2021, wherein I learned
        frontend technologies (HTML/CSS/Vanilla Javascript) to build a simple portfolio. I initially wanted to include a backend, but 
        ultimately found no valid use for one. I specifically wanted to use vanilla Js and vanilla CSS instead of frameworks/libraries as
        getting fundementals in the basics was important to me. The website will continue to grow as I work on more projects, and likely will 
        be reworked in the future (such as being rewritten in React or implementing new features). The website currently features a dynamic
        dark mode.

      <h2>Smaller Projects</h2>
      <p>I occasionally will work on smaller projects (1-4 days of work) that aren't significant enough to be listed on a main page but are cool in their own right.</p>
      <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Bot</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/tig-github/discord-tictactoe-bot"> Github </a></p>
        <p>The Tic-Tac-Toe Bot was actually the first project I ever built. It is a simple open-source discord bot written in Python using the discord.py API wrapper. The game begins
          when one user challenges another, and through typing in chat the players are able to play a game of tic-tac-toe. The project is written in 2 modules, one where all the async
          functions are contained to interact with discord, and another where the game logic is stored. The simple bot largely reinforced what I had learned in <a href="#">ICS-32.</a></p>

        <h2>Planned - Automated Spoiler Blocker</h2>
        <p class="topper">
          Currently I am in the beggining stages of developing a google chrome extension that automatically detects
          and then blocks spoilers, for now just for a few anime but eventually for a wider net of things. I'm currently
          working on developing the frontend of the extension (the popup, settings display, etc) and basic blocking functionality.
          The meat of this will be- how will the extension automatically know which spoilers to detect and then block? This will also
          only apply to text, at least for now, due to the inherent complexity in image processing. I'm researching what might be the 
          best method to do this currently. Hopefully this will be largely finished by the start of Summer.

        <h2>Project Website Launch!</h2>
        <p class="topper">
            The Project Website has not launched yet of course, but by the time this is visible to
            a wider audience it will be! This website started as an attempt to dive into the world of
            web development with a focus on sharpening my Python skills, and ended up evolving in a wildly
            different direction-instead of committing to a Django backend web app, the project instead
            became very focused on learning and utilizing frontend technologies. When launched I will
            likely discuss the technologies used here, in addition to website features.

        <p class="topper">
            This  quarter my blueprint team and I are developing a website for the purpose of promoting and 
            propogating women's safety at UCI, offering various services such as free menstrual products and safety 
            escorting. The website will feature a dynamic map featuring the location of emergency poles across the UCI
            campus, built using Google API. The frontend tech stack is React/Husky/Storybook/Yarn.

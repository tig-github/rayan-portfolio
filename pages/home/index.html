        <h2>Planned - Automated Spoiler Blocker</h2>
        <p class="topper">
          Currently I am in the beggining stages of developing a google chrome extension that automatically detects
          and then blocks spoilers, for now just for a few anime but eventually for a wider net of things. I'm currently
          working on developing the frontend of the extension (the popup, settings display, etc) and basic blocking functionality.
          The meat of this will be- how will the extension automatically know which spoilers to detect and then block? This will also
          only apply to text, at least for now, due to the inherent complexity in image processing. I'm researching what might be the 
          best method to do this currently. Hopefully this will be largely finished by the start of Summer.

        <h2>Project Website Launch!</h2>
        <p class="topper">
            This portfolio website is now hosted using github pages. This website was developed a while ago at this point, finishing around
            December of last year, and in that time I've gained interests and skills that will probably lead to me refactoring/rebuilding this 
            webpage completely. In particular I've gained interest in WebGL and the incredible backgrounds and immersion provided by the tool. It's
            the type of style I see as the future of frontend and something I'd like to get involved with. For now here is the site. I'll periodically
            update it here and there with minor updates until eventaully adding major features.

        <h2>CTC Blueprint</h2>
        <p class="topper">
            These past two quarters my blueprint team and I have been developing a website for the purpose of promoting  
             women's safety at UCI, offering various services such as free menstrual products and safety 
            escorting. The website provides important resources and hotlines in a clear and centralized location, something
            typically difficult to find with university services. Currently development is ongoing and will finish sometime at the
            end of the quarter. The frontend tech stack is React/Husky/Storybook/Yarn.

            The project is developed with the club Commit the Change at UCI, a club devoted to developing software for non-profits. This project
            is a blueprint, with the goal of providing useful services for campus/social good. More information about the club can be found at
            <a href="https://ctc-uci.com/">this website</a>.

# rayan-portfolio

Portfolio website developed using HTML/CSS, vanilla Js. Now hosted with github pages.


I want to mess with WebGL and make a more unique web design, maybe migrate site to React eventually to help with some transition issues. Many ideas now on how to improve UI/UX. For now here is the site though. As of now, no plans on moving code to React, want to use this portfolio as a way to learn and use vanilla js.

## Issue Queue:

1. webgl background, major design changes
2. transitions between pages with darkmode somewhat janky

### Completed:
~~1. get alternative to cookies working so darkmode stays across pages now that website is hosted.~~ Used localstorage for this.

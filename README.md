# rayan-portfolio

Portfolio website developed using HTML/CSS, vanilla Js. Now hosted with github pages.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I want to mess with WebGL and make a more unique web design, maybe migrate site to React. Many ideas now on how to imrprove UI/UX. For now here is the site though. As of now no plans on moving code to React, want to use this portfolio as a way to learn and use vanilla js.

Issue Queue:

1. get alternative to cookies working so darkmode stays across pages now that website is hosted.
2. take new picture for daylight image
3. webgl background, major design changes

# rayan-portfolio

Portfolio website developed using HTML/CSS, vanilla Js. Now hosted with github pages.

I want to mess with WebGL and make a more unique web design, maybe migrate site to React. Many ideas now on how to imrprove UI/UX.
For now here is the site though.

Issue Queue:
1. get alternative to cookies working so darkmode stays across pages now that website is hosted.
2. change directories to group all pages together, make images directory
3. webgl background
